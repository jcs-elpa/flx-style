# flx-style
> Completion style for flx

[![CI](https://github.com/jcs-elpa/flx-style/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jcs-elpa/flx-style/actions/workflows/test.yml)

The implementation is simply extracted from [company-flx](https://github.com/PythonNut/company-flx).

## ðŸ”¨ Usage

```el
(setq completion-styles '(flx))
```

Notice this will only eliminate the completion candidates! You will need to config
sorting function in order to get the sorting order respect to `flx` scoring algorithm.
